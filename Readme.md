## Tests

You will need to set home directories of your containers. You can set them by system property (`-Dwildfly.home` etc.) 
or create own copy of `test.properties_template` and set values:

    cp src/test/resources/test.properties_template src/test/resources/test.properties

### Running tests:

    mvn clean test -DskipTests=false
